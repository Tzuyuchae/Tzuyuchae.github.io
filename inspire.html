        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Ran Takahashi is a Japanese volleyball player who I look up to. I love volleyball and takahashi for me is such a resilient role model. He is very young and inspires me to play as he is not as tall as other volleyball players, but is very technical. I love his playing style. Unfortunately as of 1/24/2024 he suffered a severe ankle injury which has net been updated to the public yet. But knowing him, he come back stronger which is why I love Ran Takahashi.</p>
